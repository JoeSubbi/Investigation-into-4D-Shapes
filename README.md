# Investigation-into-4D-Shapes

The code and summary of an investigation into the best way in which to represent three dimensional cross sections of four dimensional objects.

## `data/`

The data collected through experimentation using the `4D Shapes` application with the `src/` directory. Data analysis and evaluation methods are included to interpret the experiment data.

## `dissertation/`

The summary and evaluation of the project and the results from the experiment; including influential literature, details on implementation as well as the conclusions draw from the evaluation of experiment data.

## `presentation/`

The slides for the presentation summarising the `4D Shapes` project, and the data collected through experimentation.

## `src/`

`4D Shapes` is a Unity Project. It is an application designed to experiment with users in order to teach and test their understand of higher dimensional geometry by exposing them to a series of primitives shapes, rotations and pose matching challenges, whilst evaluating the effectiveness of each representation.

## `status_report/`

Progress report of the project up until Christmas 2021 (Semester 1) including plan for development after Christmas (Semester 2)

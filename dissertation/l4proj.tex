    Four dimensional space is a mathematical concept that cannot be visualised in its entirety by humans. Several paradigms exist to visualise four dimensional objects in 3D, but a viewer will only be able to see a fraction of a 4D object at one time.

    Ray marching over signed distance functions provide a quick method of rendering 3D cross sections of a wide range of primitive 4D shapes.
    3D cross sections of 4D objects provides a platform to develop extended visualisations to provide a user with more information about a 4D object. Such extensions have been explored in other literature. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of extensions to 3D cross sections of 4D objects; each representation providing the user with more information in order to help them interpret and manipulate the object they are handling.

\section{The Fourth Dimension}

The world is described as three dimensional Euclidean space, conventionally referred to as $\mathbb{R}^3$. Three axes, conventionally labeled \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\), define the three degrees of translational freedom an entity can move within. All three axes that make up Euclidean space exist perpendicular to each other. Four dimensional space, conventionally referred to as $\mathbb{R}^4$, is the mathematical concept where a fourth perpendicular axes, conventionally labeled \(w\), exists perpendicular to all of the other three dimensional axes. It is impossible to visualise four dimensions in its entirety and often has to be abstracted to an analogues 3D - 2D example to reason and understand the behaviour of four dimensional entities. 

\section{Opportunities for Exploration}

Handling four dimensional space presents a number of opportunities and challenges that come with the desire to explore, interpret and manipulate higher dimensional objects. The most immediate challenge is that of being able to manipulate a four dimensional object. Rotating an object is a non trivial challenge and the most common method of rotation in 3D cannot be extended to higher dimensions. There are several ways in which users can interact with 3D objects. Another non-trivial challenge is finding intuitive ways in which a user can manipulate a 4D object through a two dimensional user interface.
\vskip 0.5em
To understand the orientation of an object, a user needs to be able to differentiate similar faces of that object from each other. Colour, patterns and textures can be applied to an object in order to assist in comprehending the current status of an object in comparison to an otherwise visually similar counterpart. An example of this is a cube rotated 90 degrees (\(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians) and the same cube rotated by 270 degrees (\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians).
\vskip 0.5em
In this paper several methods will be applied in an attempt to provide more information about a four dimensional object. Such methods include: viewing the object from other angles, attempts to visualise the object in its entirety, and abstractions of the rotation of an object in order to help understand higher dimensional rotations.

\section{Motivation}

% first, motivate then state the general problem clearly. 

Three dimensional space is very neat. There are three degrees of translational freedom expressed by the three axes \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\). There are a further three degrees of rotational freedom that are most commonly expressed as rotations about each axis. 
This supposed tidiness has lead to misconceptions that are so heavily rooted in the average persons understanding of geometry such that nearly every digital 3D system is built upon a mathematically impure foundation. 
%
In the 3D world, these misconceptions do not matter, and the mathematics is still sound. Quaternions, the most common method of controlling or interpreting rotation, is heavily used in gyroscopic devices, interactive digital 3D environments, animation and robotics. More abstract practices such as mathematics and physics, however, need to consider geometry in higher dimensional spaces.
\vskip 0.5em
A variety of fields within science and engineering utilise the visualisation of higher dimensional spaces to tackle a variety of problems. For any problem defined in \(n\) dimensional space, to understand it more intuitively, it is often suitable to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. However, when a problem is reduced to $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^2$ it may become somewhat trivial. Visualisation of 4D objects can often server as the "bridge from the 'trivial cases' to the 'nontrivial cases'", \citep{zhou_visualization_1991}. Such problems that utilise the visualisation of four dimensional space include: understanding differential geometry, collision detection, analysis of 3D objects in motion, and scalar-fields in 3D space; among others. \citep{zhou_visualization_1991}

\section{Aims}

% wide range of 4 Dimensional shape. variety of ways to display. As such the usability of each representation will be experimentally validated in order to find the most intuitive and effective way to represent higher dimensional shapes. The accuracy of which the user can identify these properties and act accordingly will be measured against the representation being shown to them.

As per the motivation for this project; an effective tutorial must be compiled together in order to explain the foundations of four dimensional geometry. A system to view and interact with 4D objects must be developed and have the capability to showcase a wide variety of 4D shapes. Research into intuitive methods of user interaction should be explored, and a system to rotate an object without gimbal lock should be employed.
\vskip 0.5em
This paper proposes several extensions to taking a 3D cross section of a four dimensional object. An evaluation will be conducted into what aspects of the geometry emphasised by these extensions are most effective when trying to interpret higher dimensional spaces, and understanding the surface, rotation and pose of a 4D object. 
%
Given a series of tests, a study will be conducted allowing a user to manipulate several 4D objects in order to evaluate their understanding of geometry, and compare their understanding against each representation of a 3D cross section. 
Metrics such as time taken, confidence and accuracy will be measured, with each metric being applied to several tests, each focusing on a different aspect of geometry in order to evaluate a users understanding of how a cross section of a four dimensional object changes under rotation.
\vskip 0.5em
This project aims to answer questions related to which representation of a 4D object using a 3D cross section is the most effective in conveying the properties of four dimensional geometry to a user with limited experience. Which representation is the most effective at representing the surface type of a 4D object? And which representation is more effective at conveying the rotational pose of an object in $\mathbb{R}^4$?
Furthermore, Does a users understanding and ability to manipulate 4D objects increase with practice? And can advantages of each representation be realised and digested by potentially inexperienced users?

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Background}

\section{Representations of the Fourth Dimension}

There are many ways to represent the fourth dimension. Arguably the most intuitive understanding is that of a 3D cross section. As with how a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be considered a a stack of infinitely thin circles that vary in size from top to bottom, along the \(z\) axis; a fourth dimensional sphere can be considered a stack of 3D spheres that vary in size as you move across the \(w\) axis.
\vskip 0.5em
The 3D cross section is limited given that only a slice of the shape can be seen at any given time. Stereographic projection attempts to rectify this by allowing a viewer to visualise as much of the shape as their field of view permits. Stereographic projection in $\mathbb{R}^3$ takes a 3D sphere and maps its geometry across a 2D plane. To map another object, for example a cube, its geometry must be projected beforehand onto the surface of a sphere \citep{radiya-dixit_visualizing_2017}. Stereographic projection in $\mathbb{R}^4$ takes the spherical projection of a 4D object, and maps it across a 3D environment. A viewer can stand in the center of the 3D environment and observe the mapped geometry. This approach of interpreting four dimensional space is well suited to virtual reality, however it is complex to interpret in a meaningful way, and abstracting an understanding to lower dimensions is nontrivial.

\subsection{Extensions to the 3D Cross Section}

Through simple discussion with peers, a 3D cross section of a four dimensional object appears to be a far more intuitive concept to grasp compared against stereographic projection. 
%
Given the aims of the project, are to investigate how one may extend a visualisation of a 4D object to provide a viewer with more information in order to assist in their understanding of higher dimensional space, the 3D cross section of a four dimensional world appears very appropriate given it's relative simplicity in using lower dimensional abstractions to assist in understanding higher dimensional geometry.
\vskip 0.5em
An extension to a 3D cross section involves providing the viewer of the object with more information about the object they are dealing with. Several such extensions have already been explored conceptually or even fully developed. 
\vskip 0.5em
Showing several cross sections besides one another, each offset along the \(w\) axis an increased amount is a simple means of trying to provide more information to the user about the entire shape of the object. For example: displaying several 2D circles that circularly increase and decrease in size besides one another provides a viewer with enough information to estimate that the object being displayed is likely a 3D sphere. 

TODO: Figure of several cross sections

\citet{kageyama_visualization_2015} proposed such a system that displays several cross sections of a 4D object along an ovular path, in order to try and provide a viewer with more information about the object. 
%
By displaying the several cross sections in an ovular path, compared to a linear path, Kageyama was able to display a far greater number of cross sections, allowing for a more detailed view of the four dimensional object in its entirety.
%
Each cross section, as they move further away from the central slice, decreases in size; in order to avoid potential confusion in conveying the idea that travelling across the fourth dimension wraps around, forming a circular path.
%
Scaling each cross section however, can produce some immediate confusion when first viewing an object. For example, taking several cross sections of a 4D cylinder that is extended along the \(w\) axis should produce several 3D spheres of the same size. Kageyama's visualisation will have each of these 3D spheres decrease in size such that a user could more likely interpret the shape to be a 3D cross section of a 4D sphere given it exhibits the same scaling behaviour. If a user interacts with the object using the appropriate keys they could observe the lack of change in the size of the 3D cross section and draw the correct conclusion.
Whilst the ovular display does provide a great deal of extra information to a viewer, it is limited by its potential to be obscure when it comes to objects with similar cross sections.

TODO: classify Kageyama's work
\vskip 0.5em
Another interesting extension which arguably provides the user with more information about an object, is being able to view said object from other angles. For example: take a cone that is extended upwards to a point. From the top, a cross section of the object will appear as a circle. However from a side on perspective, the object will appear as a triangle.

TODO: Figure of multi-view

\textit{Polyvision}, proposed by \citet{matsumoto_polyvision_2019}, is a virtual reality system to view four dimensional objects from multiple angles to quickly and effectively understand the shape being interacted with.
%
\citet{matsumoto_polyvision_2019} chose to represent 4D objects as wireframes, connecting each vertex of the object by an edge. This is possible when collapsing each vertex of the 4D object to the same three dimensional slice. This is often referred to as the "shadow" of an object. 
This allows for a user to view almost all of an object at once, in comparison to a single 3D slice, whilst offering a more intuitive understanding, although with perhaps less information, with comparison to stereographic projection. A disadvantage of a 3D wireframe shadow is with increasingly complex objects, the wireframe cells of the wireframe becomes more and difficult differentiate with the increase in the number of vertices and edges.
The ability to view the surface of a complex object, such as a 120-cell, likely allows for easier understanding of the geometry compared to the wireframe of its shadow.
%
With the goal of teaching others, \citet{matsumoto_polyvision_2019} restricts interaction to that which we are used to. Translation, rotation and scaling are restricted to the third dimension, as interaction in $\mathbb{R}^3$, from another perspective in $\mathbb{R}^4$ will change the object in a potentially unexpected way. Whilst the effects of 4D manipulation can be seen in this way, \textit{Polyvision} lacks the ability to directly manipulate an object in 4D space.

\section{Building a 4D Object}

Rendering three dimensional shapes on a 2D screen is an art that has evolved over time and ranging several disciplines. When Tron released in 1982, computers were not powerful enough to render triangle meshes in real time; as is the standard for 3D rendering nowadays. 
Similar films of that era, such as Dune 1984 or Star Wars the Original Trilogy often used a mix of practical effects and physically modifying the film. The team behind tron, however, opted to take advantage of machines to do some heavy lifting. In-spite of the technological limitations the team were able build a system to combine and render simple but smooth primitive objects. They used a system called Ray Marching \citep{sheppard_tron_2010}.
\vskip 0.5em
Today, it is standard to use triangle meshes to build and even render complex models in real time; and not just for film, but for real time interactive media such as video games.
A mesh consists of vertices, edges and faces. A vertex being a point on the surface of an object that edges connect to. A face is formed by a closed loop of edges. Generally, a face will be made up of three vertices and three edges, creating the most simple 2D shape: A triangle; which form the surface of a 3D mesh.

\subsection{Mesh Based Rendering}

Both \citet{bosch_n-dimensional_2020} and \citet{tianli_4d_2018} have developed real time interactive systems which display four dimensional objects using mesh based rendering. As illustrated by \citet{tianli_4d_2018}, 4D shapes are made up of cells, similar to how a 3D mesh is made up of faces. As with a face in a 3D mesh being constructed of triangles (the most basic 2D shape), a 4D mesh is constructed of the most basic cell, a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is made up of four triangles defined by faces, vertices and edges. The pentachoron, also known as a hyper-tetrahedron or a 5-cell, is the most primitive 4D object besides potentially the hyper-sphere. The mesh of a pentachoron consists of 5 tetrahedral sub-meshes (cells). A sub-mesh in this instance refers to a 3D mesh used to build a 4D object, in the same way a 2D net of faces can build a 3D shape.
\vskip 0.5em
Mesh based rendering allows the creation of very complex higher dimensional objects. \citet{bosch_n-dimensional_2020} built a novel game engine implementing four dimensional rigid body dynamics, as well as the rendering of a four dimensional world. 
On the other hand, \citet{tianli_4d_2018} used the readily available Unity game engine to construct a hyper-cube and hyper-tetrahedron, demonstrating the flexibility of existing software built for two and three dimensions.
\vskip 0.5em
There are two main drawbacks to mesh based rendering: The time taken to construct 4D objects, and the complexity of translating four dimensional geometry to 3D. 
%
Simple 4D Platonic solids \citep{parker_things_2014} such as the hyper-tetrahedron (5-cell), hyper-cube (8-cell) and hyper-octahedron (16-cell) are fairly straightforward. Developing complex shapes such as a the hyper-dodecahedron (120-cell) or the hyper-iscosahedron (600-cell) becomes a complex and time consuming task. 
This complexity only increase when trying to develop curve faced shapes such as a hyper-sphere, torus or cone, which are smooth. Smooth geometry generally requires hundreds of vertices as well as smooth surface shading that only add to computational load and development time.
\vskip 0.5em
In order to render a three dimensional slice of a four dimensional object, an algorithm must be employed such that a point along an edge that connects two vertices of a 4D object can be found, and connected by edges to all other points lying on the same four dimensional hyperplane that sit along the edge connect other 4D vertices of the same object. This is a fairly complex task, and only gets more complex when calculating what faces of the slice of the object to render to produce a cohesive three dimensional slice. \citet{tianli_2d_2018} demonstrates how to find the cross section of an object and the problems associated with it.

\subsection{Ray Marching Shaders}

Ray march based rendering was initially developed due to limitations in real time rendering, as a way to combine easy to define primitive objects into more complex shapes. Despite advancements in rendering capabilities, allowing even low-end computers to render complex mesh based geometry in real time, ray marching has not lost its place in the world. 
Whilst ray tracing is capable of photorealistic rendering, signed distance fields (SDFs), the core of ray marching, are still heavily used in volumetric geometry, meta-ball geometry, collision detection and ray marched shaders.
An SDF is a function that describes a signed distance to a surface relative to a point in space. \citet{quilez_distance_nodate} lists several SDFs for primitive objects as well as functions that can be applied to them.

Ray marching (Algorithm \ref{alg:raymarch}, Figure \ref{fig:raymarch}) is the processes of calculating the colour of each pixel on a screen by casting a ray from an origin point to mathematically defined geometric surface. Given an origin point and a direction, the algorithm takes the distance to the nearest surface and then marches forward by that distance to map out the surface detail. \citep{the_art_of_code_ray_2018}.

Whilst less intuitive and approachable than mesh based rendering, there are active communities which strive to build interesting or complex geometry using these mathematical expressions in conjunction with ray marching. \textit{Shadertoy}, developed by \citet{quilez_shadertoy_2013}, is a web based platform that allows anyone to create and experiment with shader based geometry.
\vskip 0.5em
A significant advantage over mesh based rendering is the ability to render a 3D cross section of a 4D object with minimal effort. The SDF of a 4D object taken over three dimensional space will produce the SDF equivalent to the cross section of the same object in a given hyper plane along the \(w\) axis.
It is not novel to ray march over primitive 4D objects such as the hyper cube or hyper sphere. Often, primitive SDFs taken over $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be easily extended to $\mathbb{R}^4$; and this is the case for many of the SDFs developed by \citet{quilez_distance_nodate}. Other 4D geometry on the other hand would need to be derived from scratch. 

\section{Rotating a 4D Object}

In $\mathbb{R}^3$ there are three degrees of rotational freedom. As there are three axes, the method of rotating an object has commonly been considered as rotating about an axis. However, in $\mathbb{R}^4$ there are six degrees of rotational freedom, despite there only being four axes. Instead, rotation must be considered as a rotation about a plane formed by two axes. Therefore the six planes of rotation in $\mathbb{R}^4$ would be \(xy\), \(xz\), \(yz\), \(xw\), \(yw\) and \(zw\).

\subsection{The Problems with Rotation}

Rotating an object in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is somewhat trivial. Given a vector $v_{xy}$ rotating an angle $\theta$ about an origin point within the \(xy\) plane, the vector will follow a circular path dictated by the following 2D rotation matrix:
% 2D Rotation Matrix
\begin{equation}
    v_{xy}' = v_{xy}\begin{bmatrix}
      cos \theta & - sin \theta \\
      sin \theta & cos \theta
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
%
Rotating an object in a space greater than two dimensions immediately becomes a nontrivial problem due to its non-commutativity. In dimensions greater than $\mathbb{R}^2$, rotation matrices can be composed into a homogeneous rotation matrix. Multiplying a vector with a such a matrix will produce a rotated vector, but doing so will likely encounter gimbal lock. Gimbal lock occurs when rotating an object considers each plane of rotation as independent from one another. As a result, if a particular plane becomes parallel with another, a degree of rotation is lost and the vector being rotated will not change as expected.
\vskip 0.5em
Introducing the quaternion: The quaternion is an extension of the complex number system. A quaternion has 4 components: \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) which describe the axis of rotation, and \(w\) which describes the amount of rotation. Quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock and can be applied to each other to perform several rotations in series.
\vskip 0.5em
Quaternions have a problem: They consider rotations as a rotation about an axis. As discussed by \citet{bosch_lets_nodate}, axial rotations are not appropriate as a generalised method of rotation across dimensions. For example, you would not consider a 2D object rotating about the \(z\) axis. It makes far more sense to stay within $\mathbb{R}^2$ and rotate about the \(xy\) plane.

\subsection{Geometric Algebra and The Rotor}

Geometric Algebra, often referred to as Clifford Algebra, is a field of mathematics describing vector space. Vector space is populated by multivectors, graded by their vector components. Most notably, multivectors are defined by their associative, distributive and anti-commutative properties \citep{baker_maths_nodate}.
A grade zero multivector is a scalar number. a grade one multivector is just a vector. Grade two multivectors are known as bivectors, which build the foundation for the rotor. A trivector is a grade 3 multivector forming a parallelepiped from 3 vectors. Finally in $\mathbb{R}^4$ there is what is known as a pseudo-scalar.
\vskip 0.5em
A bivector $b_{ab}$ is made up of two vectors \(a\) and \(b\), and has, alongside its orientation in space defined by it's vector components, two important properties: The direction of rotation, from \(a\) to \(b\), and an area, dictated by the parallelogram formed by its two vector components as illustrated by \citet{slehar_clifford_2014}. A bivector in the reverse direction, i.e from \(b\) to \(a\) fulfills the anti-commutative property such that $b_{ba} = -b_{ab}$. 
% TODO: Wedge Product similar to Cross Product
\vskip 0.5em
As mentioned above, a rotation should be considered as a rotation about a plane. A bivector defines the plane for a vector to rotate about. As demonstrated by \citet{mathoma_geometric_2017}, a rotor can rotate a vector following the principle that a double reflection forms a rotation \citep{mathoma_geometric_2016-2}.
\vskip 0.5em
In a given vector space greater than $\mathbb{R}^2$, a multivector greater than grade zero can be projected onto the vector space basis blades. A basis blade is a the plane formed parallel to two perpendicular axes. The \(xy\) blade is often referred to as $e_{xy}$ or $e_{01}$. Therefore a bivector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be decomposed into three projections onto the $e_{xy}$, $e_{xz}$ and $e_{yz}$ planes; and a bivector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ can be decomposed into 6 elements.
\vskip 0.5em
It is possible to multiply multivectors using the geometric product; a combination of the inner and outer product. Multiplying a vector \(v\) by a rotor \(R\) and it's reverse \(R^\dagger\) will rotate vector about the bivector component of the rotor.
%
\begin{equation}
    v' = R v R^\dagger,
\end{equation}
%
The angle of rotation is dictated by a scalar component of the rotor, similar to the \(w\) component of a quaternion. 
As shown by \citep{bosch_code_nodate}, the quaternion and the 3D rotor are very similar in concept. The rotor, unlike the quaternion, has the advantage of not having to leave the dimension it belongs in order to rotate a vector, allowing it to be used in \(n\) dimensions.

\section{Teaching and Evaluation}

TODO: reiterate aims and questions

It is important to ensure this complex mathematical topic is to be well communicated to individuals with little-to-no experience of higher dimensional space. \textit{The van Hiele Model of Geometric Thinking}, \citep{safrankova_van_2012}, Theorises that their are five levels of understanding geometry, where a student will progress from one level to the next. The levels of understanding include: Visualisation, Analysis, Abstraction, Deduction and Rigor, numbered 0 to 4 respectively.
Level 0 focuses on the identification and recognition of geometry using simple language. The properties that define a geometry need not be identified.
Level 1: students begin basic analysis and identification of geometry, without a need for proofs.
Level 2: students create meaningful definitions and are able to justify and reason their understanding of geometry.
Level 3: students are able to provide deductive geometry proofs, showing their understanding of formal definitions and theorems.
Level 4: students have an understanding of several proofs and can comprehend Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.

\chapter{Analysis and Requirements}

\section{Problem Specification}

The core of this project focuses on the development of a system capable of rendering several different types of four dimensional objects, and be able to view these objects through a series of extensions to the 3D cross section in order to evaluate their effectiveness in teaching potentially inexperienced users about complex geometry.

TODO: discuss evaluation- tie in with research questions

\section{Limitations}

The scope of the project is limited by two main factors: The time that can be spent on development, and the quantity to quality ratio of experimentation. 
The project is primarily separated into three components: Research, development and experimentation. The development phase would take the most time with so many areas for exploration. Such areas include the creation, stable rotation, and manipulation of 4D geometry. To evaluate the effectiveness of the representations that need to be developed however, plenty of time needs to be put aside to plan and run appropriate experiments.
Experimentation is, more often than not, limited by the number of participants that choose to be involved. To encourage the greatest number of potential participants to enroll in the experiment, the time commitment and effort cannot be so great that it deters them. Alongside the conscious effort to sign up, the experiment cannot run for such a period of time that it may effect a participants performance. As such, the amount of data that can be collected in one sitting should be maximised within a limited time frame.

\section{Prioritisation of Requirements Using MoSCoW}

MoSCoW is a prioritisation technique used in project planning. The purpose of MoSCoW is to separate the requirements of a project into four levels of priority: Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have. This process may be revisited several times during a projects development lifecycle; different requirements are often re-prioritised based on project progress or a change in direction.

\subsection*{Must Have}

The following requirements are necessary in order to conduct a successful evaluation:

A system must be developed that is capable of rendering 4D shapes. As such, several 4D shapes must be created. 
In order to test a persons understanding, of the 4D shapes that are to be developed, they must not all be immediately distinguishable from one another. For example, a hyper-cube and a hyper-sphere will never look similar to each other, whereas, the 3D cross section of a 4D hyper-cone in a particular pose will look identical to the 3D cross section of a 4D hyper-sphere.
\vskip 0.5em
The aims of the project focus on the development of several extensions to the 3D cross section in order to find what extensions are better for conveying the complexities of 4D geometry to potentially novice users. Therefore, several extensions to the 3D cross section of four dimensional space should be developed. The extensions to the 3D cross section may take inspiration from the literature mentioned earlier, and attempt to improve upon or emphasise the components of their work that are relevant to this investigation.
\vskip 0.5em
In order to prepare participants for the experiment, an introductory tutorial video will need to be assembled to teach and explain them about the complexities and features of the fourth dimension. This tutorial video must cover the behaviour of geometry in $\mathbb{R}^4$, with appropriate references to the similarities when reducing three dimensional space to a two dimensional cross section. Moreover, the video must explain rotation in four dimensions, as well as an explanation for the behaviour that occurs when rotating an object outside of the dimensions it is being viewed within. The video must have relevant diagrams and animations to appropriately depict the behaviour of 4D shapes in such a way that it will be immediately relatable to the following experiment.
\vskip 0.5em
Before running the experiments, the tests must be completed and evaluated several times by myself, with some preliminary research with a small group of peers to ensure the functionality of the system is as expected, and any restraints such as time limits are within acceptable bounds.
\vskip 0.5em
Finally the experiment must have multiple stages of testing to evaluate a persons understanding of the several aspects of geometry. The experiment must not last such a long time that it affects the participants performance. To appropriately evaluate a persons understanding alongside the effectiveness of a representation, qualitative data must be collected from the participant, about their understanding, including open and closed questions.

\subsection*{Should Have}

Whilst not a necessity, the following requirements would enhance the investigation, allowing the further exploration of the four dimensional world.

be able to interact/manipulate with them in 4D directly\\
 - implement stable 4D rotation

\subsection*{Could Have}

Given the limitations, although it would be nice to include, the following requirements are the lowest priority. The requirements will be explored, but are not necessary to conduct the investigation and will likely not be refined to a satisfactory degree.

multiple methods of direct interaction/manipulation
\vskip 0.5em
evaluation on effectiveness of texturing an object in different ways

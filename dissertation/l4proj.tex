    %\vskip 0.5em
    %``XYZ is bad. This project investigated ABC to determine if it was! better. ABC used XXX and YYY to implement ZZZ. This is particularly interesting as XXX and YYY have never been used together. It was found that ABC was 20\% better than XYZ, though it caused rabies in half of subjects.''
    4 Dimensional space is a mathematical concept that cannot be visualised in its entirety by humans. Several paradigms exist to visualise 4 Dimensional objects in 3D, but a viewer will only be able to see a fraction of a 4D object at one time.
    \vskip 0.5em
    Ray marching over signed distance functions were used in order to render 3D cross sections of a wide range of simple 4D shapes.
    Using 3D cross sections of 4D objects provides a platform to develop extended visualisations to provide a user with more information about a 4D object. Such extensions have been explored in other literature. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of ways to representing 3D cross sections of 4D objects; each representation providing the user with extra information in order to help them interpret and manipulate the object they are handling.

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Acknowledgements}
\begin{abstract}
    I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. John Williamson for the constant support and advice throughout the project, within and outside of the weekly meetings. Thanks to his guidance and support, I was able to take this project as far as I have, and fully explore the complexities of the fourth dimension.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not included in the page count. 

% From now on pages are numbered using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 

% Do not alter the bibliography style.

% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.

% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.

%==================================================================================================================================

% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion, however.

test it\\

Need to provide clear explanations of concepts early on

provide time to play with object before tests to learn controls and behaviour

 - diffuse texture - patterns give it away\\
rotation match\\
 - not diffuse texture and no sphere - no surface imperfections and can be impossible to tell if certain rotations occuring\\

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

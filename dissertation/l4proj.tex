    Four dimensional space is a mathematical concept that cannot be visualised in its entirety by humans. Several paradigms exist to visualise four dimensional objects in 3D, but a viewer will only be able to see a fraction of a 4D object at one time.
    \vskip 0.5em
    Ray marching over signed distance functions provide a quick method of rendering 3D cross sections of a wide range of primitive 4D shapes.
    3D cross sections of 4D objects provides a platform to develop extended visualisations to provide a user with more information about a 4D object. Such extensions have been explored in other literature. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of extensions to 3D cross sections of 4D objects; each representation providing the user with more information in order to help them interpret and manipulate the object they are handling.

\section{The Fourth Dimension}

The world is described as three dimensional Euclidean space, conventionally referred to as $\mathbb{R}^3$. Three axes, conventionally labeled \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\), define the three degrees of translational freedom an entity can move within. All three axes that make up Euclidean space exist perpendicular to each other. Four dimensional space, conventionally referred to as $\mathbb{R}^4$, is the mathematical concept where a fourth perpendicular axes, conventionally labeled \(w\), exists perpendicular to all of the other three dimensional axes. It is impossible to visualise four dimensions in its entirety and often has to be abstracted to an analogues 3D - 2D example to reason and understand the behaviour of four dimensional entities. 

\section{Opportunities for Exploration}

Handling four dimensional space presents a number of opportunities and challenges that come with the desire to explore, interpret and manipulate higher dimensional objects. The most immediate challenge is that of being able to manipulate a four dimensional object. Rotating an object is a non trivial challenge and the most common method of rotation in 3D cannot be extended to higher dimensions. There are several ways in which users can interact with 3D objects. Another non-trivial challenge is finding intuitive ways in which a user can manipulate a 4D object through a two dimensional user interface.
\vskip 0.5em
To understand the orientation of an object, a user needs to be able to differentiate similar faces of that object from each other. Colour, patterns and textures can be applied to an object in order to assist in comprehending the current status of an object in comparison to an otherwise visually similar counterpart. An example of this is a cube rotated 90 degrees (\(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians) and the same cube rotated by 270 degrees (\(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians).
\vskip 0.5em
In this paper several methods will be applied in an attempt to provide more information about a four dimensional object. Such methods include: viewing the object from other angles, attempts to visualise the object in its entirety, and abstractions of the rotation of an object in order to help understand higher dimensional rotations.

\section{Motivation}

\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

Three dimensional space, on the surface, is very neat. There are three degrees of translational freedom expressed by the three axes \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\). There are three degrees of rotation that are most commonly expressed as rotations about each axis. 
%
This supposed tidiness has resulted in misconceptions that are rooted in to society such that nearly every digital 3D system is built upon a mathematically impure foundation. 
%
In practice the misconceptions do not matter, and the mathematics is still sound. However it is interesting nonetheless that

comes with a series of interesting problems 

what is the benefit of trying to teach people about it?

\section{Aims}

% wide range of 4 Dimensional shape. variety of ways to display. As such the usability of each representation will be experimentally validated in order to find the most intuitive and effective way to represent higher dimensional shapes. The accuracy of which the user can identify these properties and act accordingly will be measured against the representation being shown to them.

As per the motivation for this project; an effective tutorial must be compiled together in order to explain the foundations of four dimensional geometry. A system to view and interact with 4D objects must be developed and have the capability to showcase a wide variety of 4D shapes. Research into intuitive methods of user interaction should be explored, and a system to rotate an object without gimbal lock should be employed.
\vskip 0.5em
An evaluation will be conducting into what aspects of a shape are most important when trying to interpret higher dimensional geometry, using a series of tests that evaluate the understanding of the geometry, how its cross section changes under rotation, as well as a users ability to manipulate the shape.

\section{Representations of the Fourth Dimension}

There are many ways to represent the fourth dimension. Arguably the most intuitive understanding is that of a 3D cross section.

\section{Rotating a 4D Object}

In $\mathbb{R}^3$ there are three degrees of rotational freedom. As there are three axes, the method of rotating an object has commonly been considered as rotating about an axis. However, in $\mathbb{R}^4$ there are six degrees of rotational freedom, despite there only being four axes. Instead, rotation must be considered as a rotation about a plane formed by two axes. Therefore the six planes of rotation in $\mathbb{R}^4$ would be \(xy\), \(xz\), \(yz\), \(xw\), \(yw\) and \(zw\).

\subsection{The Problems with Rotation}

Rotating an object in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is somewhat trivial. Given a vector $V_{xy}$ rotating about an origin point within the \(xy\) plane, the vector will follow a circular path dictated by the following 2D rotation matrix:
% 2D Rotation Matrix
$$V_{xy}' = V_{xy}\begin{bmatrix}
  cos \theta & - sin \theta \\
  sin \theta & cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}$$
%
Rotating an object in a space greater than two dimensions immediately becomes a non-trivial problem due to it being non-commutative. In dimensions greater than $\mathbb{R}^2$, rotation matrices can be composed into a homogeneous rotation matrix. Multiplying a vector with a such a matrix will perform a rotation but will likely encounter gimbal lock. Gimbal lock occurs when rotating an object considers each plane of rotation as independent from one another. As a result, if a particular plane becomes parallel with another, a degree of rotation is lost and the vector being rotated will not change as expected.
\vskip 0.5em
Introducing the quaternion: The quaternion is an extension of the complex number system. A quaternion has 4 components: \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) which describe the axis of rotation, and \(w\) which describes the amount of rotation. Quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock and can be applied to each other to perform several rotations in series.
\vskip 0.5em
Quaternions have a problem: They consider rotations as a rotation about an axis. As discussed by \citet{bosch_lets_nodate}, axial rotations are not appropriate as a generalised method of rotation across dimensions. For example, you would not consider a 2D object rotating about the \(z\) axis. It makes far more sense to stay within $\mathbb{R}^2$ and rotate about the \(xy\) plane.

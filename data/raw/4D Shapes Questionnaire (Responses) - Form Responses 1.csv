1/29/2022 15:12:32,1,1/29/2022,1:30:00 PM,Deuteranopia colour blindness,Kinesthetic Learning (hands on tasks),No,None,The hypersphere,Interesting to see how it affected different shapes,"Quite hard to understand in the small timeframe, but probably a bit easier if I looked at it over a longer period",It looked fancy,Hurts the eyes a bit if you look at it for too long,Easier to understand than the rest,None,Yes
1/30/2022 14:20:12,2,1/30/2022,1:23:00 PM,No,Visual Learning (graphs or diagrams),Yes,Discussion with friends and briefly watched YouTube videos on the subject.,All of it.,Simple presentation of geometry.,,Easier to consider multiple affected intersects,more complex by nature without guidance but expected of task,challenging but fantastic communication.,hard to navigate and understand rotation.,Yes
1/30/2022 20:45:00,3,1/30/2022,7:18:00 PM,no,Reading/Writing,No,what's joe has told me,the attempt to mentally visualise the 4th perpendicular axis,this helped gain a visual understanding of what a 4d object is,I am still struggling with the concept of the 4th D tbh,not sure,nothing,it again illustrated the visualisation of the 4D object,started to cave my brain a little!,Yes
1/31/2022 17:46:32,4,1/31/2022,4:02:00 PM,No,Reading/Writing,Yes,"I've briefly read about the idea that 4D shapes can be represented through 3D cross-sections the same way 3D shapes have 2D cross-sections, I don't really know anything more about the topic",The concept of rotation involving the 4th dimension ,It was simple and didn't cause my browser to lag,It didn't really give a better perspective on overall condition of the shape during rotation,"Sorry, I didn't find it helpful, it was too much information to consider at any one point and the additional perspectives were confusing",My browser couldn't handle the rendering of 4 rotating object simulteneously and the rotation was laggy so I couldn't get a good idea of what's happening with the shape,"It was the easiest to work with, my browser took it well so I could see a nice animation of what's happening with the shape",Sometimes different rotations in 4D look similar in 3D so the additional model didn't always help,Yes
2/5/2022 19:06:45,5,2/5/2022,12:00:00 PM,No,Kinesthetic Learning (hands on tasks),Yes,Calculus in high school.,"Yes, seems difficult.",Easy to identify certain shapes like the sphere. Saves sometime when trying to match the orientation (provided it's not lagging too much),It seemed a little confusing on guess the planes of rotation when there was a 3D plane of rotation involved. ,This was my favorite. It helped identify which 4D planes were on rotating on the guess planes of rotation game.,Sometimes it is a bit too much to look at and the three additional representations took away from being able to understand the first representation.,Gives you some idea of the 4D orientation.,I didn't pay much attention to it.,Yes
2/13/2022 23:26:59,6,2/13/2022,10:00:00 PM,No,Kinesthetic Learning (hands on tasks),Yes,Listening to my partner discuss his project,"Differentiating different fourth dimensional rotations, especially when combined with a third dimensional rotation",N/A,Didn't give any impression of the xyz axis,Gave a better idea of the xyz axes and which x/y/z-w rotation might be occuring,Cluttered,Was really helpful with rotation since it was easier to tell which 4D rotation was occuring,Was not very helpful when pose matching,Yes
2/16/2022 17:22:44,7,2/16/2022,4:00:00 PM,No,Visual Learning (graphs or diagrams),Yes,Light research for interest/relating to university courses,No,Showed more information at once,Maybe too much information?,Helps you understand what is happening on each axis,"Slightly misdirects you, I thought it would help with trying to make the shape rotation match but I don't feel it did.",Very useful for trying to guess what axis the rotation is on,Couldn't figure out how to make it help on the challenge when you have to match a shapes rotation.,Yes
2/18/2022 11:56:14,8,2/18/2022,11:00:00 AM,no,Visual Learning (graphs or diagrams),No,no experience,yes the concept of 4D,matching what you think to what is actually is was quite fun,the time limit set,it explains the concept of 4D in an interesting way,perhaps need more time,the testing of the concept of 4D and the understanding of the concept,"I found it quite complicated, I think if I were to do it again I would view the training video a few more times before starting the test",Yes
